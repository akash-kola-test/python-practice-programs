# Practice programs

1. Create a table with a large number of records (you can find it with a google search or use this link - https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db). Use MySQL Database. One can setup MySQL on localhost. Write some basic queries using python. Suppose you want to process/fetch a large number of records using python while keeping your memory usage low. Think of approaches on how to accomplish this and implement it.
2. Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "get_gender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female Class
3. With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program to print this list after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.
4. Write a program that can map() to make a list whose elements are squares of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).
5. Write a program anti_html.py that takes a URL as an argument, downloads the HTML from the web, and prints it after stripping HTML tags.
